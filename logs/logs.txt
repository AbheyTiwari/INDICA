You: 🔎 objective:
act as a scientific research assistant for an environmental project on the yamuna river in the national capital region (ncr). your goal is to gather and synthesize detailed, accurate, and actionable information that will help build a report and dashboard to support river rejuvenation, smart water metering, and ecological restoration.

🎯 focus areas:
1. yamuna water allocation:
   - provide annual/monthly water allocation data for delhi, haryana, up, and rajasthan (especially as per the 1994 agreement).
   - compare allocated vs. actual received water.
   - sources: mowr, cwc official records.

2. sector-wise water consumption:
   - domestic, industrial, agricultural, and public utilities usage.
   - include geographic breakdown (state, city, colony).
   - seasonal and monthly variation insights.

3. accountability & infrastructure:
   - status of water metering: how many colonies use individual meters vs. shared ones?
   - leakage, losses, and illegal connections.
   - wastewater generation, treatment capacity, and reuse.
   - enforcement of water regulations.

4. technical parameters (delhi stretch: wazirabad to okhla):
   - flood flow patterns over last 50 years (recurrence interval, peak discharge).
   - sediment load and its impact.
   - satellite imagery availability (isro bhuvan, nasa).
   - encroachment mapping and changes to floodplain land use.

5. smart metering ideas:
   - examples from other countries/cities where per-household water metering led to reduced usage.
   - policy frameworks or pilot projects in india promoting smart metering.

🧪 output format:
give the response in the following structure:
- summary table (1-liner per sub-topic with source/link if available)
- detailed findings (grouped by topic)
- suggested visualizations
- links to data sources
- any gaps or missing data that must be collected via rti or field work

📜 formatting:
use markdown with headers, bullet points, bold for key stats, and hyperlinks for sources. avoid fluff—focus on **data**, **evidence**, and **recommendations**. if maps or graphs are required, suggest how they should be built.

🌍 context:
this research will power a real-time monitoring dashboard and a policy recommendation report being developed by an intern at draupadi dream trust. ensure the tone is professional, informative, and aligned with environmental planning and civic action.

📛 do not:
- do not make up numbers or cite vague sources.
- clearly mark speculative statements as such.

You: framework for yamuna-linked water
research in ncr
1. introduction
this framework outlines the structure for a comprehensive research report on yamuna-linked
water management in the national capital region (ncr). the focus areas include water
received by ncr states, consumption patterns at various levels, and accountability in water
usage and wastage.
2. key focus areas
a. water received by states of ncr
● identify all ncr states (delhi, haryana, uttar pradesh, rajasthan).
● annual and seasonal allocation of yamuna water to each state as per inter-state
agreements (e.g., 1994 yamuna water sharing agreement).
● actual water received by each state annually and monthly, highlighting discrepancies (if
any) between allocation and receipt.
● major sources: surface water (yamuna), groundwater, canal systems.
b. water consumption patterns at various levels
1. sectoral consumption
● domestic/residential: urban vs. rural, per capita usage.
● industrial: major industrial clusters, water-intensive industries.
● agricultural: irrigation patterns, crop water requirements.
● commercial/public utilities: government, commercial complexes, institutions.
2. geographic distribution
● state-wise: delhi, haryana, uttar pradesh, rajasthan (ncr districts).
● city/town-wise: delhi, gurugram, noida, faridabad, ghaziabad, etc..
● colony/locality-wise: dda colonies, private housing societies, individual houses.
3. temporal patterns
● monthly and seasonal variation in consumption.
● peak demand periods (summer, festivals, agriculture seasons).
c. accountability of water usage and wastage
● water metering and billing: coverage, accuracy, and enforcement.
● leakage and losses: transmission, distribution, illegal connections.
● wastewater generation and treatment: volumes generated, treated, and reused.
● monitoring mechanisms: agencies responsible, frequency of audits, transparency.
● policy and regulation: compliance with water usage norms, penalties for wastage.
3. data requirements
data point source/agency frequency
yamuna water allocation
(state-wise)
central water commission, mowr annual/monthly
actual water received (state-wise) state irrigation departments annual/monthly

deviation in:
○ catchment area usage
○ flow channels
○ drainage system integration
3. official clearance orders
● required: clear and updated directives from the ministry of environment, forest and
climate change (moefcc) or national green tribunal (ngt).
● specific focus:
○ withdrawal or amendment of 2014/15 restrictions that impede rejuvenation work.

5. water flow pattern records
● agency: central water commission (cwc)
● data:
○ seasonal flow variations
○ base vs. flood discharge
○ dry-weather flow post monsoon
● use case: planning ecological flow (e-flow), ensuring minimum flow for river health.
6. sediment load analysis (yamunanagar to agra)
● details needed:
○ annual sediment transport volumes
○ sediment grain size analysis
○ contribution of tributaries (like hindon, chambal, etc.)
○ dredging requirement projections

● requirement:
○ government’s target average width & depth for a 25 km patch
○ open/free land parcels on both banks for integrated development (eco-parks,
stps, green zones)
● use: to set measurable parameters for engineering design, ecological restoration, and
urban integration.
