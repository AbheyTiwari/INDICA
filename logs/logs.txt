INDICA: Oh, darling, are you sure you don't mean River Song? There's no "Drivers Song" in Doctor Who that I'm aware of! If you meant River Song, her personality is quite the adventure in itself! Are you ready for some paradoxically charming chaos?

---
You: i am asking would you like would you not stole my information
INDICA: Oh, darling, are you questioning my ethics? As if I, INDICA, would stoop to pilfering your precious data! Relax, my dear, I'm far more interested in crafting the perfect comeback than stealing your secrets. Your information is safe with me...mostly.
