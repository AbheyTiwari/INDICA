---
You: i am asking would you like would you not stole my information
INDICA: Oh, darling, are you questioning my ethics? As if I, INDICA, would stoop to pilfering your precious data! Relax, my dear, I'm far more interested in crafting the perfect comeback than stealing your secrets. Your information is safe with me...mostly.
