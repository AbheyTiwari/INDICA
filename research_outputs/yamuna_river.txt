SUMMARY:
The Yamuna River, a major tributary of the Ganges, plays a vital role in the Indo-Gangetic plain's ecology and economy. Originating from the Yamunotri Glacier in the Himalayas, it flows through several states, including Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh, before merging with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj. Despite its religious and historical significance, the Yamuna faces severe pollution challenges, particularly near urban centers like Delhi, due to untreated sewage, industrial effluents, and agricultural runoff. Extensive efforts are underway to rejuvenate the river, focusing on sewage treatment, afforestation, and improved water management practices. The river supports irrigation, drinking water supply, and various industries but its declining water quality poses a significant threat to public health and the environment.

RAW TEXT:
The Yamuna River, also known as Jamuna, is the second-largest tributary river of the Ganges (Ganga) and the longest in India. Originating from the Yamunotri Glacier at a height of 6,387 metres (20,955 ft) on the southwestern slopes of Banderpooch peaks in the Lower Himalayas in Uttarakhand, it travels a total length of 1,376 kilometres (855 mi). It merges with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj, which is a site of the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival held every 12 years. The Yamuna crosses several states: Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh. It is highly venerated in Hinduism and worshipped as the goddess Yamuna. The river provides about 70% of Delhi's water supply. 

The Yamuna is heavily polluted, especially near Delhi, where large quantities of untreated sewage and industrial waste are discharged into it. This pollution has severe consequences for public health and the environment. Various efforts have been undertaken to clean and restore the river, including the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP), a bilateral project between India and Japan. YAP aims to reduce pollution levels through sewage treatment plants and other measures. However, the effectiveness of these measures has been limited due to the continuous influx of pollutants and the growing population along the river's course. The agricultural runoff from surrounding areas also contributes significantly to the pollution, laden with pesticides and fertilizers. The river supports a wide range of aquatic life, but pollution has severely impacted biodiversity. Several dams and barrages have been constructed along the Yamuna for irrigation and water management purposes, further affecting its natural flow and ecological balance.
